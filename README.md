# playwright-python

## Description

This is a Python project, dedicated to enhancing my learnings for Python. In particular this project is to go through the Python Tutorials in Python Crash Course 3rd Edition.

## Requirements

### Installing Dependencies and Dummy Run
This Python project assumes your using a virtual environment. After cloning this project, from the root directory you will need to:

1. Set up a local virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate it
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the example script to make sure it's working
```
python chapter_01/hello_world.py
```
6. Deactivate the virtual environment
```
deactivate
```
If you were able to run `hello_world.py` inside the `chapter_01` folder then you should be good to run all other examples in this project. Remember that you're output should look something like this:

```
(venv) ➜  python-crash-course git:(main) ✗ python chapter_01/hello_world.py 
Hello world
```
Note that you should be seeing the `(venv)` since your using a virtual environment.
